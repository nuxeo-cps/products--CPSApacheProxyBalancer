Introduction
============

The installation has to be done on two sides: the CPS side and the Apache side.


Installation on the CPS side
============================

Add the `CPSApacheProxyBalancer` product to your Zope Products directory
and then restart all the Zope instances part of the ZEO cluster.

Then you just need to import the `CPS Apache Proxy Balancer` profile in the
`portal_setup` tool.


Installing the Apache modules
=============================

Commands to install the necessary modules::

  $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
  Module rewrite installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy
  Module proxy installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy_http
  Enabling proxy as a dependency
  Module proxy is already enabled!
  Module proxy_http installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
  Enabling proxy as a dependency
  Module proxy is already enabled!
  Module proxy_balancer installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.


Apache configuration
====================

All the details for the Apache configuration are to be found on the following addresses:

- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html
- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html

Apache configuration::

  <VirtualHost 192.168.2.20:80>
    ServerName www.mysite.net

    RewriteEngine on

    <Proxy balancer://cluster>
      # Zope puts double quotes around cookie content,
      # and mod_proxy_balancer's parser isn't too smart and reads up to
      # the first "." (included) it finds and keeps the rest.
      # So the route for "joeuser.route" is route" (note the only one and final ").
      # And route is composed with the hostname and the directory name of the
      # concerned Zope instances.
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9080 route=www.mysite.net.zc0"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9081 route=www.mysite.net.zc1"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9082 route=www.mysite.net.zc2"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9083 route=www.mysite.net.zc3"
      ProxySet stickysession=BALANCEID
    </Proxy>

    RewriteRule ^/(.*)
    balancer://cluster/VirtualHostBase/http/%{HTTP_HOST}:80/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [P,L]

  </VirtualHost>

In the code above you need to replace the values `zc0`, `zc1`, `zc2`, `zc3`, by
the directory names of your Zope instances. In this example the Zope instances
are located as follows::

  /home/zope/zc0
  /home/zope/zc1
  /home/zope/zc2
  /home/zope/zc3

And for example, for a different layout such as::

  /var/lib/zope/zeo/1
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/2
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/3
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/4

the routes would be::

  route=www.mysite.net.1"
  route=www.mysite.net.2"
  route=www.mysite.net.3"
  route=www.mysite.net.4"


How to debug
============

To test and debug your setup, set the `LogLevel` for the Apache virtual host to
a helpful verbosity.

Also set the `timeout` parameter of the Proxy to a small value, for example
10 seconds.

Apache debug configuration::

  <VirtualHost 192.168.2.20:80>
    ServerName www.mysite.net

    LogLevel debug

    RewriteEngine on

    <Proxy balancer://cluster>
      # Zope puts double quotes around cookie content,
      # and mod_proxy_balancer's parser isn't too smart and reads up to
      # the first "." (included) it finds and keeps the rest.
      # So the route for "joeuser.route" is route" (note the only one and final ").
      # And route is composed with the hostname and the directory name of the
      # concerned Zope instances.

      BalancerMember http://localhost:9082 route=www.mysite.net.zc2"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9083 route=www.mysite.net.zc3"
      ProxySet stickysession=BALANCEID timeout=10
    </Proxy>

    RewriteRule ^/(.*)
    balancer://cluster/VirtualHostBase/http/%{HTTP_HOST}:80/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [P,L]

  </VirtualHost>
