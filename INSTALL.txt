Introduction
============

The installation has to be done on two sides: the CPS side and the Apache side.


Installation on the CPS side
============================

Add the `CPSApacheProxyBalancer` product to your Zope Products directory
and then restart all the Zope instances part of the ZEO cluster.

Then you just need to import the `CPS Apache Proxy Balancer` profile in the
`portal_setup` tool.


Installing the Apache modules
=============================

Commands to install the necessary modules::

  $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
  Module rewrite installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy
  Module proxy installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy_http
  Enabling proxy as a dependency
  Module proxy is already enabled!
  Module proxy_http installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.

  $ sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
  Enabling proxy as a dependency
  Module proxy is already enabled!
  Module proxy_balancer installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.


Apache configuration
====================

All the details for the Apache configuration are to be found on the following addresses:

- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html
- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html

Apache configuration::

  <VirtualHost 192.168.2.20:80>
    ServerName www.mysite.net

    RewriteEngine on

    <Proxy balancer://cluster>
      # Zope puts double quotes around cookie content,
      # and mod_proxy_balancer's parser isn't too smart and reads up to
      # the first "." (included) it finds and keeps the rest.
      # So the route for "joeuser.route" is route" (note the only one and final ").
      # And route is composed with the hostname and the directory name of the
      # concerned Zope instances.
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9080 route=www.mysite.net.zc0"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9081 route=www.mysite.net.zc1"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9082 route=www.mysite.net.zc2"
      BalancerMember http://localhost:9083 route=www.mysite.net.zc3"
      ProxySet stickysession=BALANCEID
    </Proxy>

    RewriteRule ^/(.*) balancer://cluster/VirtualHostBase/http/%{HTTP_HOST}:80/cps/VirtualHostRoot/$1 [P,L]

  </VirtualHost>

Routes
------

In the code above you need to replace the values `zc0`, `zc1`, `zc2`, `zc3`, by
the directory names of your Zope instances. In this example the Zope instances
are located as follows::

  /home/zope/zc0
  /home/zope/zc1
  /home/zope/zc2
  /home/zope/zc3

And for example, for a different layout such as::

  /var/lib/zope/zeo/1
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/2
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/3
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/4

the routes would be::

  route=www.mysite.net.1"
  route=www.mysite.net.2"
  route=www.mysite.net.3"
  route=www.mysite.net.4"

Hostname and several hosts
--------------------------

On the other hand, the 'www.mysite.net' part is the hostname of the
server the ZEO client runs on, as obtained, e.g., by the UNIX command
'hostname'.

In the above example, they were all running on the same
machine, which is a common setup on multiprocessor machines.

Now assume that you have two servers, whose hostnames are
'app1.mysite.net' and 'app2.mysite.net', each one hosting two ZEO
clients with the following layout::

  /var/lib/zope/zeo/zc0			(port 9080)
  /var/lib/zope/zeo/zc1			(port 9081)

then the balancer members section would be::

  BalancerMember http://app1:9080 route=app1.mysite.net.zc0"
  BalancerMember http://app1:9081 route=app1.mysite.net.zc1"
  BalancerMember http://app2:9080 route=app2.mysite.net.zc0"
  BalancerMember http://app2:9081 route=app2.mysite.net.zc1"

assuming of course that your system resolves 'app1' and 'app2' to their IP
adresses correctly.


How to debug
============

To test and debug your setup, set the `LogLevel` for the Apache virtual host to
a helpful verbosity.

Also set the `timeout` parameter of the Proxy to a small value, for example
10 seconds.

Apache debug configuration::

  <VirtualHost 192.168.2.20:80>
    ServerName www.mysite.net

    LogLevel debug
